    "The world of medical imaging is ripe for a revolution in terms of deploying CNN based technologies. There is no need for a doctor or a health care provider to ponder these images to gauge things. This is not a shot at doctors or their jobs! The task of reading these is incredibly menial and repititive. Those are two things that AI technologies are great at. I will be working with some more bio-medical imaging dataset just to get more practice and probably create some web applications online for atleast one of them!!"
